                    <p>
                        Roger Walton Harris III was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on December 9th, 1989.
                        He only spent about two years in Louisiana before moving to San Antonio, Texas, where
                        he would spend a majority of his childhood. He enjoyed being outside, playing sports,
                        riding his bike, or exploring with his friends. He also enjoyed playing board games, checkers and chess with his dad, playing video games, or just messing
                        around on the computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2004 he moved to Daphne, Alabama, where he attended Daphne high school. He graduated in 2008, and
                        decided to attend Auburn University. Not knowing exactly what he wanted to do with his life, he switched
                        majors from business to journalism to psychology and then to graphic design, which he stayed in for a year.
                        But even graphic design wasn't really for him, so he pursued a degree in Computer Science. Never having
                        programmed <br>a single line of code before, he instantly took to it and loved it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Auburn taught him the basics of programming, but he wanted more. In January of 2014, Roger moved to
                        New York City with his girlfriend, Allison, and their two cats, Pixel and Java. After driving a
                        14-foot U-haul truck 15 hours with two sedated cats in the front cab in order to beat a blizzard that
                        was about to hit New York City, Roger settled in and started his internship at Health Guru Media. Here, he learned the ins and outs of Web Development. After his internship (and a merger with Kitara
                        Media), Roger was brought on as a full time junior developer to further develop his skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In his free time, Roger enjoys spending time with his girlfriend, watching movies, reading a good book,
                        and listening to music. He also enjoys playing music. He has been playing the bass guitar since the Spring
                        of 2005, and has since then picked up guitar and some drums as well. While attending college at Auburn
                        University, he <br>was in 4 different bands, each very uniquely different from the others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first band he joined, Blame Sydney!, was a ska/punk rock band whose main purpose was to play
                        fun music for their friends and have a good time doing it. For a brief period in time, he also joined the band SummerTrees with his friend Richard from Blame Sydney. He played lead guitar for the few months they were together. After they went their seperate ways he focused mainly on Blame Sydney. The second band he was in, Gypsies With Knives,
                        he joined because they were in dire need of a new bassist. He had known the band members after previously
                        playing with them in Blame Sydney, so it was an easy fit for him. Gypsies With Knives consisted of an
                        eclectic mix of classic rock, punk rock, reggae, funk, and blues. Finally, in his last semester of college,
                        he helped out a friend by playing for his sister's cover band. Entitled the Cheri Blossoms, they were a cover
                        band that played classic rock, country, alternative rock and pop songs.
                    </p>

                                </h3>
                                <p class="list-group-item-text">
                                    Before joining the Daphne high school marching band in the summer of 2006, Roger had
                                    no prior experience with music theory of any kind. During the pre-semester band camp,
                                    he was taught the basics of keys, scales, and reading musical clef in only a few days.
                                    The three songs he had to learn for the marching band's show were more complicated
                                    than anything he had previously learned, being mostly jazz based. He practiced day
                                    and night to perfect the bass lines, since this was his first time playing with a
                                    band of any kind.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The first year he was with the Marching band, the show consisted of three varied songs:
                                    "", "Stairway to Heaven", and "". His parts consisted of mostly jazzy and rock-oriented
                                    bass lines, with a walking bass line in "". The guitar section, which consisted of Roger
                                    on bass and his friends Ben White and Mark Parrish on guitar, was featured prominently
                                    in Stairway to Heaven during the guitar solo. The second year's show was more thematic,
                                    based around three songs by the jazz guitarist Pat Metheny: "", "", "". Since Roger was
                                    the only guitarist this year, and he considered himself more experienced than the year
                                    before, his parts were more prominent.
                                    <br><br>
                                    During his stint in the Daphne marching band, they competed in regional competitions
                                    against other marching bands. Titled "The Sound of the Eastern Shore", they were known
                                    for their excellence in all categories and frequently took home awards for best
                                    performance, best drum major, best music, and more. The marching band also took part
                                    in the annual parades during Mardi Gras. In a couple such parades, Roger marched along
                                    the with the band and played bass drum.
